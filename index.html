            <h2> Introduction</h2>
            <p> Tom Bombadil is a character in J.R.R. Tolkien's mythical universe known as "Middle-Earth". His first appearance was in a 1934 poem published in The Oxford Magazine called "The Adventures of Tom
                 Bombadil". He also appears in the much more well-known "The Fellowship of the Ring" published in 1954, where he saves the hobbits on their way to Mordor and teaches them some valuable 
                 lessons and speaks in nonsensical ways. Sadly Tom Bombadil's story never made it to the big screen when Peter Jackson adapted the legendary trilogy and thus most fans have never heard 
                 of Tom. He is a quite enigmatic figure and said to be the oldest being in all of Middle-Earth.</p>

            <h2>Quotes</h2>
            <blockquote>"Fair lady!' said Frodo again after a while. 'Tell me, if my asking does not seem foolish, who is Tom Bombadil?'
                'He is,' said Goldberry, staying her swift movements and smiling. Frodo looked at her questioningly. 'He is, as you have seen him,' she said in answer to his look.”</blockquote>
            <blockquote>“Say rather that the Ring has no power over him. He is his own master. But he cannot alter the Ring itself, nor break its power over others. And now he is withdrawn into a little land, within bounds that he has set, though none can see them, waiting perhaps for a change of days, and he will not step beyond them.”</blockquote>    
            <blockquote>”No,' said Gandalf, 'not willingly. He might do so, if all the free folk of the world begged him, but he would not understand the need. And if he were given the Ring, he would soon forget it, or most likely throw it away. Such things have no hold on his mind. He would be a most unsafe guardian; and that alone is answer enough.'”</blockquote>
